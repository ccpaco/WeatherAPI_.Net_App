# Web Services Console App using C# .Net 


A simple Console App that utilizes WSDL (Web Services Definition Language) from http://webservices.oorsprong.org/websamples.countryinfo/CountryInfoService.wso?WSDL


Should you choose to download and run it, the file Program.cs should be set as your startup project. Output will be as shown below. Although this project involved a bit of setup
through Visual Studio and IDE feature, so just copying the code doesn't allow it to run. Overall it was an interesting project for my Full Stack App Development Manager class.


Under WeatherStations -> Program.cs you would need to input your individual token from NOAA for the code to work.
